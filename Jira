There are a lot of tasks that were made on Jira and some stuff have been carried over from assignment 1. As of the current moment, there is nobody committing to the Jira updates and this was practically the same for assignment 1. I had to tell someone in my group that it was not done, and for the majority of it, I was doing the reporting on Jira. It seems like people do not care for this assignment at all.

The creation of new tasks were also made by me. So it is quite time consuming doing this all by myself.
