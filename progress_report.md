# ELEC1005-report-progress
This is a record of the progress of the report including powerapps progress

So far, the only person that has done any progress regarding the report drafts and progress is me (John Le) so far. There is nobody writing anything or doing anything that I have delegated. 

So far I am almost completely finished with the development of the powerapps template for the EventPortal AI app. For the report, I have written 5 test cases that revolve around the login, signup, and logout functions of the app. They have all passed my test case successfully. 

Things to develop:
 - The test case in powerapps for the five test cases that I have made.
 - Write on the user manual for the report
 - Finish the last few panels of the application.
